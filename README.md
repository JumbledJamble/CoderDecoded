Put simply, Coder:Decoded is a simple CRUD app with with TODO app structure. However, unlike most simple TODO apps, it has an elegant UI, many features, industry standard authentication w/ jwt, and displays many graphs to the user breaking down their time usage. To run, ensure you have a .env file in the root folder. The .env needs 3 variables, "DATABASE_URI", "ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET", and "REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET".

Once you have the .env and have installed dependencies, simply run the start script or npm run dev.
